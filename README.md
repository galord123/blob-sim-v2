# blob-sim-v2
The project is a graphical simulation for natural selection.

The simulation will genarate random Blobs to start the simulation and food.
Each Blob will need food to survive and reproduce.
Once a blob has enough food it will look for a mate, and if the mate have enough food too, they will reproduce.

When reproducing, their genes will be mixed and past to their children (with a chance for mutation).

The genes are:
  - color
  - speed
  - radius
  - sight

For the current time, you have only the option to see the graph of their population
and interact with the amount of food added to the simulation.

The results show a clear natural selection. As time grows more adapted Blobs survive and reproduce.
